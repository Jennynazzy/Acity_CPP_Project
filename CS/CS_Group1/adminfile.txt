This is going to be our personal workspace where well be able to discuss / put some miscellaneous details we want to say or do without putting it in the actual code : 

Cyril : 
    - i need to make a class where it will get the user information about the new tasks with description , priority and deadlines. 
        {
            - i have made the class file for the getting and setting of the task information , its called task.h which contains all variable declaration as well as the enums 
            - i have made the class implementation file where it sets the priority levels with the enums and its in the task.cpp file

            - i am about to make the task management class file as well as its implementation file
